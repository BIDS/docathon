:summary: Tips and tricks to help you contribute to documentation!



Contributing to a project is often a daunting challenge. Each project has an
idiosyncratic way of organizing folders, accepting contributions, writing
examples, etc. Fortunately, documentation is a great way to get started. You
can usually make noticeable improvements to a package without knowing the full
details of the project’s API, and there are always improvements to be made in
documentation.

However, it can be hard to figure out how to contribute to a project’s
documentation. As a part of the Docathon, there are several projects in need
of some documentation help. Here are some ways that you can help out.

  - **Review tutorials, examples, and written documentation.** Ideally keeping a
    critical eye open for opportunities to improve the materials. This is an
    excellent opportunity to learn a bit more about your favorite library and
    propose improvements, fix typos, write a new paragraph, or improve one!

  - **Look for issues that are labeled as documentation.** Many projects have
    a list of issues related to documentation. Check out if there are any
    issues labeled Documentation and new-contributor-friendly, e.g.:
    https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3ADocumentation+label%3Anew-contributor-friendly.
    If you can’t find any, you can always open an issue to offer your services
    as a documenter!

  - **Improve API/function documentation.** API documentation should clearly
    explain the usage and meaning of *all* inputs and outputs for functions,
    objects, etc. This is extremely important for ensuring that the package is
    easy to use. However, many packages fall short of this goal. Ensuring that
    the documentation fits a common format (such as numpydoc for Python
    projects) makes this job a lot easier. If the documentation isn’t already
    in a common format then submit an issue suggesting converting the
    documentation, or make this format switch yourself for a few functions in
    a pull-request. If there is already a clear formatting preference in the
    package, then perhaps you can improve under-documented functions or make
    existing documentation clearer.

  - **Contribute new examples.** Look through the examples provided in a
    project’s documentation and see if there are any glaring omissions. Is
    there some function that you use that isn’t covered in the examples? If
    so, you could create a short script that shows off the functionality. If
    you see two examples showcasing the same feature, try merging them!

  - **Improve the language of examples.** Many examples / tutorials /
    vignettes are thrown together relatively quickly and are often written in
    an unclear and overly complex way. Check the comments and narrative
    sections of the documents and think about how they could be improved. If
    you see ways to improve the language, open an issue or submit a pull
    request with your suggested changes.

  - **If there are contribution guidelines**, adhere to them as much as
    possible. This will reduce the amount of time needed to get your
    contribution merged into the main codebase. Either way, try to style any
    new contributions so that they’re similar to what is already there.

We hope this helps you get started!
