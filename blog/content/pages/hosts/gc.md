# Digital Fellows @ Graduate Center Digital Initiatives
The Digital Fellows, part of the Graduate Center Digital Initiatives at The Graduate Center (CUNY), will be hosting a Docathon. The first day will be focused on tutorials and getting people started. We then will have support throughout the week via our office hours and Python User's Group.

## Launch event
Monday February 6th is the Docathon's first day! We're hosting a launch event where we'll provide you with an introduction to some projects, a discussion of good documentation practices, and help setting up your development environment. You can work on your own personal project or help out on one of the participating projects. Participants of all skill-levels are encouraged to join.
