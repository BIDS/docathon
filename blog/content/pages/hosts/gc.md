# Graduate Center Digital Initiatives

The Graduate Center Digital Initiatives at The Graduate Center (CUNY) will be hosting a Docathon. The first
day will be focused on tutorials and getting people started. We then will have support throughout the week

## Launch event

Monday February 6th is the Docathon's first day! Learn about the tools and
best practices for writing good documentation. We will dedicate this first day to
getting you started on writing documentation. The morning will be dedicated to
tutorials, while the afternoon will be hands on for your favorite project. 
## Daily meetings

The Digital Fellows will be supporting docathon activities via office hours (Tuesday 2:00-4:00)
