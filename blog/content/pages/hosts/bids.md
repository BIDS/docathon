# Berkeley Institute for Data Science

The Berkeley Institute for Data Science will be hosting a Docathon. The first
day will be focused on tutorials and getting people started. We then will have
daily meetings, and a last warp up event!

## Launch event

Monday February 6th is the Docathon's first day! Learn about the tools and
best practices for writing good documentation. We will dedicate this first day to
get you started on writing documentation. The morning will be dedicated to
tutorials, while the afternoon will be hands on on your favorite project. We will
provide food and refreshments.

## Daily meetings

BIDS will be hosting Docathon daily meetings from **4pm to 6pm**. We will all
gather to hack documentation together in BIDS 190B.

## Wrap up event

We will finally wrap up this week of Docathon with a small get together where we can 
share the progress made on your favorite project's documentation!
BIDS will provide food and drinks.
