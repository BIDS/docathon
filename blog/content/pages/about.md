# About

The Docathon team believes that coding is inherently part human, part machine. We spend a lot of time trying to perfect the machine half of that equation, often at the detriment of the human half. The Docathon is a place where we remember that ultimately, the tools we write will be used by other people, and it's crucial that those people are able to understand and utilize these tools effectively.

The idea behind the Docathon began at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/), though the goals of the organization are not attached to any particular institution. We welcome help from the broader open source community, and encourage anybody to host their own docathon. Below is our core organizing team:

* [Chris Holdgraf](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/chris-holdgraf)
* [Nelle Varoquaux](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/nelle-varoquaux) 
* [Stefan van der Walt](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/st%C3%A9fan-van-der-walt)
* [Dmitriy Morozov](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/dmitriy-morozov)
* [Matthias Bussonnier](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/matthias-bussonnier)
* [Teon Brooks](http://teonbrooks.github.io)

If you'd like to get involved in organizing, shoot us an email or open an issue on our repository.
