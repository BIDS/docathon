# Hosts


While it's totally fine to participate inthe Docathon remotely (all you
need to do is contribute to documentation!), some will
gather at host sites for tutorials, hacking sessions on a specific
project, or simply to share a good time amongst documentation-lovers!

Here is a list of organizations / groups that are holding docathon parties
during the week. You are welcome to host your own Docathon, [click here](hosting.html).
If you'd like join one of these locations, check out the details of the
specific events. Don't forget to register if necessary!

  - [BIDS, UC Berkeley, CA](hosts/bids.html)
  - [eScience Institute, UW Seattle, WA](hosts/uwescience.html)
  - [Digital Fellows (GCDI), The Graduate Center, NY](hosts/gc.html)

If you are doing a remote Docathon, but would like to be part of a greater
community, we have a [slack channel](https://docathon.slack.com) for
communicating before and during the week. You can [request an
invite](https://docathon.herokuapp.com/) here, or go directly to
[https://docathon.slack.com](https://docathon.slack.com) if you already have a
login.
