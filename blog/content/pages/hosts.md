# Hosts


While the Docathon is primarly a remote event, where opensource developers
choose to focus on documentation for a specific week of the year, some will
gather around for tutorials, hack together on a specific
project or simply share a good time amongst documentation-lovers!

Here is a list of organizations / groups that are holding docathon parties
during the week. You are welcome to host your own Docathon, [click here](hosting.html).
If you'd like join one of these locations, check out the details of the
specific events. Don't forget to register if necessary!

  - [BIDS, UC Berkeley, CA](hosts/bids.html)
  - [eScience Institute, UW Seattle, WA](hosts/uwescience.html)
  - [Digital Fellows (GCDI), The Graduate Center, NY](hosts/gc.html)

If you are doing a remote Docathon, but would like to be part of a greater
community, we have a [slack channel](https://docathon.slack.com) for
communicating before and during the week. You can [request an
invite](https://docathon.herokuapp.com/) here, or go directly to
[https://docathon.slack.com](https://docathon.slack.com) if you already have a
login.
