# Hosts

While it's totally fine to participate in the Docathon remotely (all you
need to do is contribute to documentation!), some will
gather at host sites for tutorials, hacking sessions on a specific
project, or simply to share a good time amongst documentation-lovers!

Here is a list of organizations / groups that are holding docathon parties
during the week. You are welcome to host your own Docathon, [click here](hosting.html).
If you'd like join one of these locations, check out the details of the
specific events. Don't forget to register if necessary!

If you'd like to work remotely, but want to be part of a greater
community, we have a [slack channel](https://docathon.slack.com) for
communicating before and during the week. You can [join here](https://docathon.herokuapp.com/), or go directly to
[https://docathon.slack.com](https://docathon.slack.com) if you already have a
