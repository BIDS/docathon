## Description
Hdbscan is a Python clustering library for hierarchical density based clustering. It provides high performance implementations of two clustering algorithms: HDBSCAN* and Robust Single Linkage, as well as a suite of tools for further analysis, including plotting tools, cluster validations measures, prediction, and soft clustering. The hdbscan library conforms to Scikit-learn, and seeks to provide an easy to use interface for fast and easy clustering, particularly for exploratory data analysis.
