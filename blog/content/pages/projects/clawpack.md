## Description
Clawpack (“Conservation Laws Package”) is a collection of finite volume methods for linear and nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Clawpack employs high-resolution Godunov-type methods with limiters in a general framework applicable to many kinds of waves.  It includes a number of subpackages including one for geophysical applications, adaptive mesh refinement, and high-order methods via WENO methods.
