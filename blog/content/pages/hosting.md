Summary: Information about hosting a Docathon.
Status: hidden

Want to host a Docathon remotely? It is very easy! We welcome anybody to join in from around the world. We will coordinately loosely before / during the event, but feel free to do things the way that you'd like to.

Here's what to do:

* create a pull request on our [Github 
repo](http://github.com/BIDS/docathon). In this PR, there should be:
  * A new file in `blog/content/pages/hosts/XX.md` where `XX` is the name of your institute. [here's a link to the folder](https://github.com/BIDS/docathon/tree/master/blog/content/pages/hosts).
  * This file should contain the following information:
    - When are you meeting?
    - How to get to the host place?
    - Are you organizing anything special during this week?
  * Make the PR on the master branch.

To see an example, look at the list of hosts presented [here](hosts/bids).

If some of that is confusing to you, then don't hesitate to open an issue on our repo [here](https://github.com/BIDS/docathon/issues)

[Here's a list](hosts.html) of the groups that are participating so far!
