Summary: Information about hosting a Docathon.
Status: hidden

Want to host a Docathon remotely? It is very easy! We welcome anybody to join in from around the world. We will coordinately loosely before / during the event, but feel free to do things the way that you'd like to.

Just create a pull request on our [Github hosted
website](http://github.com/BIDS/docathon), with a new file in
`content/pages/hosts/XX.md` where `XX` is the name of your institute. This
file should contain the following information:

  - When are you meeting?
  - How to get to the host place?
  - Are you organizing anything special during this week?

To see an example, look at the list of hosts presented [here](hosts/bids).

[Here's a list](hosts.html) of the groups that are participating so far!
