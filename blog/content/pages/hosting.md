Summary: Information about hosting a Docathon.

You'd like to host a Docathon? It is very easy!

Just create a pull request on our [Github Hosted
website](http://github.com/BIDS/docathon), with a new file in
`content/pages/hosts/XX.md` where `XX` is the name of your institute. This
file should contain the following information:

  - When are you meeting?
  - How to get to the host place?
  - Are you organizing anything special during this week?

To see example, look at the list of hosts presented [here](hosts/bids).
