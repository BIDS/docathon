<h2>What's a docathon?</h2>
<p>
During the week of <strong>March 6th, 2017</strong>
, we encourage developers of all skill
levels to focused on developing material and
tools for documentation from home or at one of our host locations.

<h2>Why a docathon?</h2>
Everybody knows how important documentation is. 
However, as important as it is, we often don't give documentation enough
attention. Functions are often missing argument explanations,
examples don't run or reveal outdated APIs, tutorials are often
idiosynchratic (or not even there). The docathon is about changing that.

<h2>How do I join in?</h2>
