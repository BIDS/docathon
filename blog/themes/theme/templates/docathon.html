<h2>What's a docathon?</h2>
<p>
It's kind of like a hackathon, but focused on developing material and
tools for documentation. Hackers of all skill-levels are welcome.
<strong>The docathon will be held in January/February of 2017</strong>,
stay tuned for more details on dates. It will hopefully be the first
of many docathons to come!

<h2>Why a docathon?</h2>
Everybody knows how important documentation is. 
However, as important as it is, we often don't give documentation enough
attention. Docstrings are incomplete or missing argument explanations,
examples don't compile or reveal outdated APIs, tutorials are often
idiosynchratic (or not even there). The docathon is about changing that.

<h2>How Do I Join In?</h2>
All you need is a project to work on that isn't your regular day job. We
recommend you choose something open, perhaps on GitHub or Bitbucket, so that
others can see your progress. In the coming weeks we'll send out a formal call
for ideas and projects, and you can sign up then either as a project host
or as a contributor.
