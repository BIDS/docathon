<h2>What's a docathon?</h2>
<p>
It's kind of like a hackathon, but focused on developing material and
tools for documentation. Hackers of all skill-levels are welcome.
<strong>The docathon will be held the week of March 6th, 2017</strong>.
We'll have a kickoff event on the 6th, and then a week of hacking and
documenting. We hope you'll join us in person or online!

<h2>Why a docathon?</h2>
Everybody knows how important documentation is. 
However, as important as it is, we often don't give documentation enough
attention. Docstrings are incomplete or missing argument explanations,
examples don't compile or reveal outdated APIs, tutorials are often
idiosynchratic (or not even there). The docathon is about changing that.
