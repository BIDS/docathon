# Docathon

This is the github repository used to organize the docathon.

Tentative dates: Jan, 23rd, 2017 to Jan, 30th, 2017.
Where: anywhere!
Who: anyone who wants to contribute to opensource project's documentation!

## Random Notes

The BIDS space is reserved Jan, 23rd from 6pm to 9pm.
See with Tracy for food.

Chris and I were recently discussing the poor state of documentation on many
projects, and how hard it is to take the time to write good documentation.
Chris suggested doing a sprint focused on documentation across opensource
projects. It would be a good place for some projects to focus on a particular
point (e.g, the effort of moving matplotlib’s example gallery to sphinx
gallery), or for a couple of documentation project to get some love (numpydoc,
sphinx-gallery).
This initiative could also interest some developers from NYU and UW (Jake
Vanderplas, Andy Mueller) and people outside of the MS funding.
To encourage people to actually work on the documentation, it should be
possible to adapt julython (https://github.com/julython/julython.org -
http://www.julython.org/) to detect commits with the “DOC” tag.
Launch Date: Jan, 23rd 2017 @ BIDS
